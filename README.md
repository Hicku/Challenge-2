# Challenge-2

## Description
This website was created to showcase my current and future work as a web developer. It is also one of my first projects so I'm also using it to practice everything I've learned using HTML and CSS. It has taught me the struggle of using css to layout the structure of the page and adding functions. It took hours of reseach to work out the problems I can accross. 

##Usage

Using the website requires simple navigation using the navigation bar accross the header. Clicking each button will take the user to a different part of the page. In one section they will be taken to images of one piece of work, and placeholder images for future work. These all act as links to a website. the first will link to my first site.
